### We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse

On the 15th to 22nd of November, 2021, we, the Glasgow Agreement, will take on multinational Total all over the world in decentralized direct actions.  

## Call to Action

For more than half a century, governments, investors and executives of corporations like Total have been fully aware of the consequences of their decisions on widespread biodiversity loss and the destruction of all forms of life. 50 years of scientific reports and citizen mobilization; 50 years of broken promises; disinformation, greenwashing, lobbying. Among others, Total is one of the key actors in this destruction. Whilst humanity is reaching the limits of its own planet, they refuse to change.  

Itâ€™s time for people to take matters into their own hands the need to collectively cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep fossil fuels in the ground.  

We will not stand by and watch history, we will create our history.  

[{{< organisations_count >}} organisations from 54 countries](../organisations/) have signed the Glasgow Agreement. Now, we call on everyone for a global day of decentralized direct action and acts of non-cooperation to stop one of the most powerful and ecocidal actors on the Planet.  

We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse.  

**We call on all organisations from the climate justice movement and beyond to collectively disrupt Total's operations\* on the 15th to 22nd of November, using a diverse array of tactics for powerful, creative and compassionate actions.**  

**Join the Global Day of Action Collapse Total by subscribing the call to action [here](https://framaforms.org/collapse-total-call-to-action-1627950762) or by writing to glasgowagreement@riseup.net**
