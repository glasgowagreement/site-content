# Over 80 organisations have signed the Glasgow Agreement committing to the creation of plans to cut 50% of global greenhouse emissions by 2030

While international institutions and governments have once again halted action on climate change, over 80 organisations and grassroots movements from around the world have come together to sign an agreement to stop climate chaos. The Glasgow Agreement commits these organisations to develop nationally based inventories of infrastructures and sectors to be shutdown in the next decade, and then creating a climate agenda to achieve to indispensable emission cuts. The agreement was signed today at the From the Ground Up - Gathering for Climate Justice
This new step forward by the climate justice movement includes many platforms such as MOCICC, from Peru, Plataforma Boliviana frente al Cambio Climatico (Bolivia), Alianza Mexicana contra el Fracking and 2020 Rebelión por el Clima (Spain), but also many Fridays for Future climate strikers (USA, Brazil, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Uganda, Argentina, Philippines, France, Belgium, Romania, Netherlands), Extinction Rebellion chapters (Wales, Ireland, Gambia, Spain, the Netherlands, many german cities) and diverse movements, NGOs and trade unions such as Climáximo, Code Rood, Acción Ecológica, Ecologistas en Acción, ATTAC Maroc, Rising Tide UK, LINGO, Fundação Arayara, ELA Euskal Sindikatua, South Durban Community Environmental Alliance, Justiça Ambiental or HOMEF.  

The diversity of these movements is also the strength of this agreement, that will focus on creating plans for action and concrete action in the next decade, to create the handbrake that stops fossil fuel insanity from leading our civilisation into collapse.  

In three months, the signing members will present their first territorial inventories of emissions, and then they will begin the political and social process of constructing a climate agenda from below, that answers not only to the climate crisis, but the many social, health, environmental and economic crisis that have cursed the last decades of late capitalism. Other groups, excluding political parties and churches, may sign the Glasgow Agreement after this first official signing.  

No longer will we wait for their plans. It is time to make our own, and to stop accepting the lame excuses that have stopped climate action in the last three decades, putting us on the brink of destruction. We are the ones we have been waiting for.
