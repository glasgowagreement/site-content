# Drill Baby, Drill

In this report and annex we present 184 oil and gas wells that were drilled and completed in 2021, as well as more than 800 additional oil and gas wells to be drilled between now and the end of 2022.  

We hold little expectation that international institutions, national or regional governments will curtail, block or cancel these wells. They have, in fact enabled them, and have always stood by them. They have chosen climate collapse.  

Each one of these wells represents not only Ecocide, but a suicidal project for Humanity.  We will not wait for oil & gas companies to stop choosing profit over life. They never stopped, and they never will, unless we make them.  

We therefore call on the climate justice movement, as well as all social movements and civil society, to spread this information far and wide, to act on it, to campaign on it, and to block and stop any and all of these projects.  

The moment has come for us to take our future into our own hands.
