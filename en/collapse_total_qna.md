## 1. What is the purpose of this action? Why focusing in 1 company?

We understand that civil society must have its own plan of action to achieve the necessary emissions cuts, and no longer wait for governments and international institutions to act.  Stooping the fossil industry is a global problem, so we need to coordinate our actions globally to achieve the needed impact.  

Focusing in one company on a specific time frame, allows the climate justice movement and beyond to establish a joint initiative that tackles that company across different continents, nations, projects and interests, disrupting it's operations.  

Fossil capitalism is a global system with highly articulated components that allow for it to absorb local shocks and disruption with minor adaptation or cosmetic changes. It needs to be shocked and disrupted globally for meaningful impact.

In more internal conversations we can also add:  

The purpose of this action is to establish a joint initiative that tackles the same company across different continents, nations, projects and interests. Focusing on one company will allow us to test and perceive if we can magnify the impact of international coordinated actions by measuring actual effects of these actions, the impact across the different interests and operations of the company.  


## 2. What kind of actions are you calling for?

We are calling for powerful, creative and compassionate direct actions and acts of non-cooperation, focusing on Total's infrastructures around the world.  

We invite you to read [here](../agreement/) the point 5 of Glasgow Agreement about political and economic non-cooperation.  

You can also read [here](../faq/#15-what-is-the-advantage-of-focusing-on-infrastructures) what is the advantage of focusing on infrastructures.  


## 3. What can I do?

If you are an individual you can share the call with groups you are part of and with your networks; Write articles about Total; Share what others are doing (actions, campaigns, etc)  

Can you help with design, with press contacts or finding funds fro groups that need support? Let us know by e-mail!  

If you are an organization, join the call - do a direct action to disrupt Total’s operations! Moreover, share the call in your networks as well as share others’ actions :)  


## 4. Total isn’t present in my group’s territory. How can we join the call to action?

If Total does not operate in your territory you can still join the call by conducting direct action to other major infrastructure present in your territory :)  

If you are part of Glasgow Agreement you might want to look to your territory inventory. Anyway shouldn’t be difficult to find infrastructures of fossil industry nearby.  

Note: in this case, please use in communication "Collapse [company name], to avoid total collapse" or "Collapse [company name] before [company name] collapse us".

## 6. Is there any coordination of communication and mobilization materials?

Yes!  

### About Social Media

In all post you do about the action – announcing you will do it, run up actions, the action itself,…  – please always put the action hashtags!  

\#CollapseTotal  
\#TotalCollapse

E.g:

This way we all can share with each other what are we doing and boost each other!  

Note: whenever you feel safe, also tag directly Total Company -> @TotalEnergies  

We will compile all the actions in Glasgow Agreement social media (if any information is missing, let us know!).  

### About Mobi Materials and Action Materials

Each action will be adapted to local context resulting in a diversity of actions. To show that we are all united have at least 1 banner with “Collapse Total” and "Glasgow Agreement" in your action. This can be the logo or the sentence “Collapse Total to Avoid Total Collapse”.  

If you want to, you can also have flags and stickers with collapse total and/or glasgow agreement. Soon we will have documents available to be printed.  

You can find the logos and images [here](../brand/).

## 7. What kind of support is given?

Glasgow Agreement is as great as the effort put by the member organizations.  

Right now we don’t support financially actions - If you don’t know funds that can support you, we can send information about it.  

If you need to connect with other groups: i) from your territory; ii) that are working in similar subjects; iii) to do a solidarity action; we can help making these connections!  

Any request please say so by email and we will check if any member organization can address it!
