{{< icon-title "dark/justice" "What is the purpose of" "the Glasgow Agreement?">}}

The purpose of the Glasgow Agreement is to reclaim the initiative from governments and international institutions and create an alternative tool for action and collaboration, for the climate justice movement. Until now the climate justice movement has had a very big focus on pressuring governments to take action on climate, or to push for stronger international agreements within the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), such as the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 or the Paris Agreement in 2015. Meanwhile, emissions have continued to rise. Hence the Glasgow Agreement proposes that civil society proposes its own plan of action, no longer waiting for governments and international institutions to do so. We aim to use a vast array of strategies and tactics, including civil disobedience, to achieve the necessary emissions cuts to prevent a 1.5ÂºC temperature rise by 2100.  

{{< icon-title "dark/organic_doc" "How can my organisation" "join the process?">}}

Any social movement or organisation, small or large, local, regional, national, or international, can join, except for political parties, commercial companies and churches (religious groups can join). It is not necessary that your organisation be legally registered in your country for you to participate.  

This Agreement is made of organisations, not individuals. Although individuals can commit to help build the Glasgow Agreement, attend the assemblies and take part in working groups, they cannot make political proposals, particularly for the Agreement text.  

To join the Glasgow Agreement process, please fill and submit the [contact form](/contact).
