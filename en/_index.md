{{< icon-title "dark" "protest" "Collapse Total">}}

On the 16th to 18th of November, 2021, we, groups that signed the Glasgow Agreement - Peoples' Climate Commitment, will take on multinational Total all over the world in decentralized direct actions and acts of non-cooperation.  

We call everyone to join us and collectively disrupt Total's operations using a diverse array of tactics for powerful, creative and compassionate actions to stop one of the most powerful and ecocidal actors on the Planet.  

**We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse.**

{{< icon-title "dark" "justice" "What is the purpose of" "the Glasgow Agreement?">}}

The purpose of the [Glasgow Agreement](./agreement) is to reclaim the initiative from governments and international institutions by creating an alternative tool for action (inventory and climate agenda) and a space for strategy and coordination for the climate justice movement. Until now the climate justice movement has had a very big focus on pressuring governments to take action on climate, or to push for stronger international agreements within the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), such as the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 or the Paris Agreement in 2015. Meanwhile, emissions have continued to rise. Hence the Glasgow Agreement proposes that civil society proposes its own plan of action, no longer waiting for governments and international institutions to do so. We aim to use a vast array of strategies and tactics, including civil disobedience, to achieve the necessary emissions cuts to prevent a 1.5ÂºC temperature rise by 2100.

### Ask Us Anything Calls

*What is The Glasgow Agreement? Who decides the climate justice agenda? What happens when a group signs up? How are decisions made? Do I have to travel to Glasgow now?*  

Getting involved with the Glasgow Agreement can be as intimidating and confusing as it is rewarding and impactful. In order to facilitate the onboarding process the Outreach Group has launched a new initiative: Monthly "Ask Us Anything" calls.  

At these short, one hour calls we'll have a short presentation of the Glasgow Agreement, a summary of the last assembly and finally an open section where you can ask all the questions you ever wanted! These calls will be open to organisations that have just joined the Agreement and are trying to understand how it works, organisations that are considering joining but would like to know more, and individuals who are part of the Agreement but cannot attend the assemblies.  

The next session of Ask us Anything calls will take place on the **29th of May at 2PM GMT.**
