>[FR] L'exploitation des ressources pétrolières et minières dans le Parc National des Virunga à l'est de la RdCongo dans le Nord-Kivu est une menace de trop pour les déplacés climatiques et les communautés locales déjà victimes de plusieurs atrocités dont les injusctices climatique et les guerres à répétition . C'est sûrement ce qu'on fait savoir ce 15 novembre les  déplacés vivant dans un campement de fortune se trouvant dans le Rutshuru à travers une activité de mobilisation dans le cadre de la campagne #Collapse Total avec notre mouvement #Xrrutshuru. Nous allons implémenter énormément d'actions pour totalement effondrer Total et exiger nettement une réparation des dommages causés par les pays pollueurs.

This is surely what we let know this 15th November the displaced living in a fortune camp in Rutshuru through a mobilization activity as part of the #Collapse Total campaign with our #Xrrutshuru movement. We are going to implement huge actions to completely collapse Total and demand clearly repair the damage caused by polluting countries.

## Systemic Change and Glasgow Agreement

The Glasgow Agreement aims to reclaim the initiative from governments and international institutions by creating an alternative tool for action (emmissions inventory and climate agenda) and a space for strategy and coordination for the climate justice movement. We are more than 170 organisations, united by the understanding that systemic change is needed as well as a common definition of [climate justice](../agreement/).  

We understand that civil society must have its own plan of action, and no longer wait for governments and international institutions to act. We aim to use a vast array of strategies and tactics, including civil disobedience, to achieve the necessary emissions cuts to prevent a 1.5ºC temperature rise by 2100. This will be the first of many diverse actions.  

You can sign and join the Glasgow Agreement [here](../contact/).  

### We are the ones we have been waiting for.
