### We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse

On the 15th to 22nd of November, 2021, we, the Glasgow Agreement, will take on multinational Total all over the world in decentralized direct actions.  


## What's Happening?

### DR Congo - Rutshuru

Exploitation of oil and mining resources in the Virunga National Park east of RD Congo in North Kivu is a threat to climate displaced people and local communities already victims of several atrocities including climate injustice and repeated wars.  

This is certainly what the displaced living in a makeshift camp in Rutshuru made known on 15 November through a mobilisation activity in the framework of the #Collapse Total campaign with our movement #Xrrutshuru.

On the 20th November, members of local communities bordering the giant Virunga National Park protest and mobilized others to urgently prevent the new projects of the company Total including oil extraction in the Virunga landscape.  

They will keep the fight to collapse Total and to demand clear reparation for the damage caused by the polluting countries.

## Systemic Change and Glasgow Agreement

The Glasgow Agreement aims to reclaim the initiative from governments and international institutions by creating an alternative tool for action (emmissions inventory and climate agenda) and a space for strategy and coordination for the climate justice movement. We are more than 170 organisations, united by the understanding that systemic change is needed as well as a common definition of [climate justice](../agreement/).  

We understand that civil society must have its own plan of action, and no longer wait for governments and international institutions to act. We aim to use a vast array of strategies and tactics, including civil disobedience, to achieve the necessary emissions cuts to prevent a 1.5ºC temperature rise by 2100. This will be the first of many diverse actions.  

You can sign and join the Glasgow Agreement [here](../contact/).  

### We are the ones we have been waiting for.
