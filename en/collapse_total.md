## Collapse Total

### *We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse*

*On the 16th to 18th of November, 2021, we, the Glasgow Agreement, will take on Total all over the world in decentralized direct actions.*  

# Call to Action

For more than half a century, governments, investors and managers of companies like Total have been fully aware of the consequences of their decisions on the destruction of biodiversity and all forms of life. 50 years of scientific reports and citizen mobilization, 50 years of broken promises, disinformation, greenwashing, lobbying. Total is one of the key players in this destruction, although not the only one. Humanity is reaching the limits of its own Planet and they just refuse to change.  

It’s time for people to take matters into their own hands the need to collectively cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep fossil fuels on the ground.  

We will not stand by and watch history, we will create our history.  

[170 organisations from 54 countries](https://glasgowagreement.net/en/organisations/) signed the Glasgow Agreement. Now, we call on everyone for a global day of decentralized direct actions and non-cooperation actions to stop one of the mightiest and most ecocidal company of the Planet.  

We need to collapse Total to avoid total collapse.  

**We call on all organisations from the climate justice movement and beyond to disrupt Total\* on the 16th to 18th of November with a diverse array of tactics for powerful, creative and compassionate actions.**  

**Join the Global Day of Action Collapse Total by subscribing the call to action [here]() or by sending an email to glasgowagreement@riseup.net**  

\* *If there is no Total in your territory you can still join the call by doing an direct action to other major company/infrastructure present in your territory.*  

# Systemic Change and Glasgow Agreement

The Glasgow Agreement aims at reclaiming the initiative from governments and international institutions by creating an alternative tool for action (inventory and climate agenda) and a space for strategy and coordination for the climate justice movement. We are more than 170 organisations, united by the understanding that a systemic change is needed and a common definition of [climate justice](https://glasgowagreement.net/en/agreement/).  

We understand that civil society must have its own plan of action, no longer waiting for governments and international institutions to act. We aim to use a vast array of strategies and tactics, including civil disobedience, to achieve the necessary emissions cuts to prevent a 1.5ºC temperature rise by 2100. This will be the first of many diverse actions.  

You can sign and join the Glasgow Agreement [here](https://glasgowagreement.net/en/contact/).  

#### We are the ones we have been waiting for.
